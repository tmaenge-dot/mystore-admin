Slide 1 — Title
- "Hello, I'm [presenter name]. Today I'll show how MyStore helps Thuso present wholesale products, accept orders, and manage images without complex tooling."

Slide 2 — The problem
- "Small retailers often rely on phone and WhatsApp for orders. That creates manual friction—image updates and bulk pricing are slow."

Slide 3 — Our solution
- "MyStore provides a minimal admin UI and a responsive storefront. Admins can upload images and publish them quickly. Customers can order with bulk pricing support."

Slide 4 — Key features
- "Uploads are validated server-side, filenames are sanitized, and optional image resizing protects the storefront. Orphan cleanup reduces storage costs. Audit logs record changes."

Slide 5 — Demo flow
- "I'll walk through an upload: admin logs in, uploads a product image, the storefront refreshes and shows the updated image. Then we create a cart, save it server-side, and perform a test checkout."

Slide 6 — Pricing / Pilot
- "We propose a four-week pilot to integrate MyStore with Thuso's catalog and, optionally, S3 for presigned uploads and a production DB."

Slide 7 — Screenshots
- "Here are screenshots of the demo storefront and the admin upload screen."

Slide 8 — Ask & Next Steps
- "If Thuso likes this, we can scope a pilot next week. We'll need sample product data and access to any inventory system you want integrated."
